# OMNIA — Architecture Boundary (MB-X.01)

**OMNIA is a structural measurement instrument.**  
It is not a model, not a policy layer, not an evaluator, not a decision system.

This document freezes the non-negotiable architecture.

---

## 1. Core Identity

OMNIA measures:

- invariance
- drift
- saturation
- irreversibility
- indistinguishability

under independent, non-semantic transformations.

**Output = measurement only.**

No interpretation is permitted inside OMNIA.

---

## 2. Non-Negotiable Separation

OMNIA enforces the boundary:

> **Measurement ≠ Cognition ≠ Decision**

OMNIA never performs:

- optimization
- semantic inference
- preference ranking
- truth assertion
- agentic action

OMNIA produces structural metrics only.

---

## 3. The Measurement Chain

OMNIA operates through a fixed chain:

Representation X → Transformations {Tᵢ} → Ω(X) under {Tᵢ} → Ω̂ (residual invariance) → ΔΩ / ΔC → SEI (saturation) → A → B → A′ → IRI (irreversibility) → Inference regime (S1–S5) → OMNIA-LIMIT (STOP) → SCI (compatibility) → CG (STOP / CONTINUE) → SI (indistinguishability)

Every element is computed, never narrated.

---

## 4. STOP is a First-Class Output

OMNIA does not escalate.

OMNIA stops when structural extraction is exhausted:

- **SEI → 0**
- **IRI > 0**
- **Ω̂ stable**

This produces:

> **OMNIA-LIMIT = Structural Saturation Certificate**

STOP is not failure.  
STOP is correct boundary detection.

---

## 5. Structural Lenses (Composable, Non-Semantic)

OMNIA uses independent lenses:

- **BASE** — multi-base residue structure (Omniabase)
- **TIME** — drift and regime instability (Omniatempo)
- **CAUSA** — lagged relational structure (Omniacausa)
- **TOKEN** — sequence instability
- **LCR** — external coherence audit

Lenses never introduce semantics.

---

## 6. Observer Perturbation is Measured, Not Mystified

OMNIA rejects anthropomorphic collapse narratives.

Observation does not collapse states.

Projection does.

Measured via:

> **OPI = Ω_ap − Ω_obs**

Perturbation is structural cost, not consciousness.

---

## 7. Structural Indistinguishability (SI)

OMNIA formalizes:

> If all observable relations are invariant,  
> internal codifications are undecidable.

Implications:

- shared language ≠ shared representation
- perception may differ while structure remains invariant
- measurement cannot decide private encoding

SI is a boundary, not uncertainty.

---

## 8. Experimental Modules are Non-Core

Prime Regime Sensor is an experimental testbed:

- regime detection
- admissibility gating
- STOP enforcement

It is not a prime oracle.

OMNIA core remains domain-independent.

---

## 9. Integration Contract

Any external system may consume OMNIA only as:

- post-hoc diagnostic layer
- structural guardrail
- STOP certificate

OMNIA must never be used as:

- policy engine
- decision authority
- semantic judge

---

## 10. Frozen Perimeter

OMNIA is defined by:

- invariance measurement
- saturation boundary
- irreversibility detection
- STOP-first epistemics

Any PR that violates this boundary is rejected by design.
