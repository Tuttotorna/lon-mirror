# DELTA Policy Demo — ICE Artifact

This notebook demonstrates a structural decision policy based on
boundary saturation, instability, and internal contradiction.

The policy operates post-generation and is model-agnostic.

- Boundary regime detection (OPEN / NEAR / SATURATED)
- Loss criticality assessment
- Compressibility test
- Deterministic REFUSE / ALLOW decision
