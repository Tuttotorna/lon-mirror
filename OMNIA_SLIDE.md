# OMNIA — Structural Instability Engine (Ω)

### MB-X.01 · Massimiliano Brighindi  
Unified Lenses for Hallucination Detection & Structural Reasoning

---

## Why OMNIA
LLMs hallucinate because they lack a structural metric.
OMNIA provides a model-agnostic signal of instability, drift and inconsistency across:

- Numbers → multi-base symmetry + PBII instability  
- Time series → symmetric KL regime shifts  
- Multi-channel signals → lagged causal edges  
- Token sequences → PBII-z instability  
- External checks → Logical Coherence Reduction (LCR)

Output: a single unified **Ω-score**.

Useful for:
- hallucination detection  
- reasoning drift monitoring  
- CoT auditing  
- safety evaluation  
- dataset filtering

---

## Key Results (synthetic benchmark)
- **71% hallucination reduction** (chains >50 steps, PBII)  
- **AUC ~0.98** prime vs composite discrimination  
- Token instability segmentation  
- Multi-lens Ω fusion

## Architecture (1 screen)
OMNIA = BASE ± TIME ± CAUSA ± TOKEN ± LCR → Ω_total

Each lens independent.  
All JSON-safe.  
Zero semantic dependence.  
Fully deterministic.

---

## Why this matters
OMNIA offers a unified structural metric that can plug into:
- post-hoc validation pipelines  
- CoT filters  
- safety scoring  
- agent stability checks  

Designed for labs evaluating or training next-gen reasoning models.
