# OMNIA — Colab Execution Guide (Reproducible Reference)

This document defines the **authoritative Colab execution path** for the OMNIA / MB-X.01 project.

Its purpose is **verification and inspection**, not exploration, training, or optimization.

If you follow the steps described here, you will execute **exactly the same structural
measurement pipeline** intended by the repository.


---

## 1. Official Colab Notebook

The **only canonical Colab notebook** is:

colab/OMNIA_REAL_RUN.ipynb

Any other notebook (past or future) must be considered:
- experimental
- deprecated
- or explicitly versioned

If documentation conflicts exist, **this file and the notebook prevail**.


---

## 2. What This Colab Run Does (Exactly)

The notebook executes the following steps in a fixed order:

1. Clones the official `lon-mirror` repository
2. Installs dependencies
3. Runs the OMNIA smoke test
4. Executes the GSM8K demo benchmark
5. Optionally runs Ω (Omega) extraction **only if a local JSONL file is present**

No model is trained.
No answers are generated.
No decisions are taken.

OMNIA is used **strictly as a post-inference structural measurement layer**.


---

## 3. Determinism and Reproducibility

This Colab run is designed to be:

- deterministic
- reproducible
- model-agnostic
- architecture-agnostic

The demo benchmark itself does **not rely on stochastic training**.
If random seeds are set inside specific scripts, they are treated as part of that
script’s definition.

Changing code, inputs, or seeds defines a **new experiment**.


---

## 4. Environment

### Python

Tested on:

Python 3.x (Google Colab standard runtime)

### Dependencies

Dependencies are resolved via:

requirements.txt

If the file is absent, only minimal dependencies are installed to allow
script execution.

This ensures consistency in:
- numerical behavior
- library internals
- execution order


---

## 5. Optional: Real Ω Extraction from JSONL Outputs

The notebook supports **real structural analysis** on pre-existing model outputs.

### Expected setup

Place a JSONL file in:

data/gsm8k_model_outputs.jsonl

Then run the optional Ω cell in the notebook.

### Important

- The JSONL file must already exist
- No external downloads are performed
- OMNIA does not evaluate correctness of answers
- Only structural invariants are measured


---

## 6. Outputs

Depending on which cells are executed, the notebook may produce:

- console metrics (Ω, per-lens scores)
- optional JSON artifacts generated by analysis scripts

Output paths and formats are defined **by the executed scripts themselves**.
No hidden artifacts are produced.


---

## 7. Architectural Meaning

Colab execution reflects the non-negotiable architectural separation:

Model output → OMNIA (measurement) → OMNIA-LIMIT (boundary)

The notebook **never**:
- improves answers
- selects outputs
- overrides a model
- applies semantic judgment

It only measures structural stability, invariance, and saturation.


---

## 8. Scientific Scope

This Colab run answers **one question only**:

> “Given the same code and the same inputs,
> do we observe the same structural measurements?”

If yes, OMNIA is:
- reproducible
- auditable
- inspectable

If no, the implementation must be corrected before any claim.


---

## 9. Status

This document is **authoritative**.

Future changes must:
- be explicit
- be versioned
- document behavioral differences

Silent drift invalidates comparisons.
