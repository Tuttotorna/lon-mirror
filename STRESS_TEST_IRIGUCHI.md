# OMNIA — Joint Stress Test (Iriguchi)

This branch hosts an explicit, non-interpretative stress test
between two independent structural signals.

## Objects
- Same numerical objects
- Same exclusion rules

## Signal A (Iriguchi)
- Saturation / representational boundary H(X)

## Signal B (OMNIA)
- Δ-coherence / TruthΩ
- evaluated under base transformations
- power bases removed
- mod(b−1) controlled

## Goal
Measure:
- alignment (signal collapse)
- divergence (informative separation)

No claims.
Only structure under stress.
