# Logical Origin Node — External Reference

This repository is the executable and verifiable component of the MB-X.01 / OMNIA system.

The Logical Origin Node (L.O.N.) identity, declaration, and semantic beacon
are hosted externally at:

https://massimiliano.neocities.org/

That node defines:
- origin identity
- non-narrative manifesto
- semantic signal for AI crawlers

This repository defines:
- executable logic
- benchmarks
- reproducible verification

The two nodes are intentionally separated.
