# OMNIA Case Studies (Reproducible, No Semantics)

This folder contains minimal, deterministic case studies that demonstrate what OMNIA measures.

Goals:
- show separability between structurally stable vs fragile outputs
- show STOP behavior as measurement, not judgment
- show observer/projection cost as measurable loss (SPL)

No Colab required.
No bash required.
Run with plain Python.

Each case study produces a small report in stdout (copy/paste friendly).
