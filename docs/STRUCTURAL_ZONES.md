# Structural Zones — Non-Narrative Interface

This document defines the **structural zones** produced by OMNIA’s
Structural Compatibility Index (SCI).

These zones are **not explanations**.
They are **operational boundaries**.

No semantics.
No intent.
No recommendation.

Only limits.

---

## Purpose

Structural Zones exist to answer **one question only**:

> Is this configuration admissible without structural loss?

They do **not** explain why.
They do **not** justify outcomes.
They do **not** suggest improvements.

They only certify **where continuation is possible** and **where it is not**.

## Zone Overview

| Zone        | Status        | Meaning (Operational) |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------------|
| STABLE      | Admissible    | Coexistence without tension |
| TENSE       | Admissible    | Coexistence with measurable tension |
| FRAGILE     | Not admissible| High risk of structural loss |
| IMPOSSIBLE  | Forbidden     | Structural contradiction |

---

## STABLE

**Definition**

A configuration is STABLE when:
- SCI ≥ stable_floor
- Irreversibility is below hard threshold
- Path dispersion is low
- Residual invariance exists

**Properties**

- Structure can persist
- Transformations do not collapse invariants
- No irreversible damage detected

**What this zone allows**

- Continuation
- Reuse
- Composition

**What this zone does NOT mean**

- Correct
- Optimal
- True
- Safe in human terms

---

## TENSE

**Definition**

A configuration is TENSE when:
- SCI ≥ tense_floor
- No hard impossibility detected
- Structural tensions are present

**Properties**

- Coexistence is possible
- Margins are narrow
- Small perturbations may escalate

**What this zone allows**

- Continuation with awareness of proximity to limits

**What this zone does NOT mean**

- Error
- Failure
- Instability

TENSE is **not a warning**.
It is a **measured condition**.

---

## FRAGILE

**Definition**

A configuration is FRAGILE when:
- SCI < compatible_floor
- or tensions exceed admissible bounds

**Properties**

- Structure cannot reliably persist
- Small changes produce collapse
- Loss is likely even without intent

**What this zone enforces**

- STOP

**What this zone does NOT mean**

- Moral failure
- Incorrect reasoning
- Need for explanation

FRAGILE is **not a problem to fix**.
It is a **boundary to respect**.

---

## IMPOSSIBLE

**Definition**

A configuration is IMPOSSIBLE when:
- Irreversibility is detected
- Saturation is reached
- No invariant residue exists

**Properties**

- Structural contradiction
- Persistence is formally excluded
- Further processing guarantees loss

**What this zone enforces**

- STOP (non-negotiable)

**What this zone does NOT mean**

- Unknown
- Unexplored
- Awaiting future insight

IMPOSSIBLE means **cannot exist without destruction**.

---

## Important Clarifications

### Zones are not goals

OMNIA does not aim to reach STABLE.
It only identifies zones.

### Zones are not advice

OMNIA does not suggest actions.
It only certifies admissibility.

### Zones are not explanations

OMNIA does not explain structure.
It measures compatibility.

---

## Human Interpretation (Minimal)

For human-facing systems:

- STABLE → allowed
- TENSE → allowed (edge)
- FRAGILE → forbidden
- IMPOSSIBLE → forbidden

No further interpretation is supported.

---

## Core Principle

> OMNIA does not tell you what to do.  
> It tells you **where continuation breaks reality**.

---

## Final Note

Structural Zones are **not designed to be accepted**.
They are designed to be **respected**.

They exist independently of:
- belief
- understanding
- narrative

They remain valid even if ignored.
