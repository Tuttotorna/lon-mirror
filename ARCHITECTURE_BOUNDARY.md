# OMNIA — Architecture Boundary

## Purpose
OMNIA is a **structural measurement layer**.
It does not generate answers.
It does not optimize objectives.
It does not decide outcomes.

OMNIA **measures structural coherence** under transformation.

---

## What OMNIA DOES

- Computes **TruthΩ (Ω-score)** as invariance under multi-base transformations
- Measures internal stability via:
  - Δ-coherence
  - κ-alignment
  - ε-drift
- Evaluates **resistance to representation changes**
- Produces **machine-readable scalar scores**
- Acts as:
  - verification layer
  - gating signal
  - anomaly / instability detector
- Operates **model-agnostically**
- Can be composed with any upstream or downstream system

---

## What OMNIA DOES NOT

- Does NOT generate content
- Does NOT rank truth semantically
- Does NOT replace reasoning engines or LLMs
- Does NOT enforce policies or alignment
- Does NOT optimize for human preference
- Does NOT claim absolute truth
- Does NOT decide correctness

---

## Epistemic Position

- Truth is treated as **structural invariance**, not semantic agreement
- Ω-score is **continuous**, not boolean
- High Ω indicates resistance, not certainty
- Low Ω indicates fragility, not falsity

---

## Integration Model

OMNIA is designed to be integrated as:

- Pre-filter (input validation)
- Post-filter (output verification)
- Parallel observer (diagnostic signal)
- Gating signal for external decision systems

OMNIA never overrides decisions.
It only **measures and reports**.

---

## Architectural Separation

[ Generator / Reasoner / LLM ] ↓ OMNIA ↓ [ External Decision / Policy / Agent ]

OMNIA remains **epistemically neutral**.

---

## Design Constraint

Any extension violating these boundaries
is considered **out of scope** for OMNIA.
