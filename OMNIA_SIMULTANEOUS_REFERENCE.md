OMNIA — Principle of Simultaneous Reference
OMNIA does not eliminate any reference system (unit, zero, base, scale, arithmetic).
Each reference remains valid as a lens, not as a law.
All references are active simultaneously.
None is privileged. None is excluded.
Structural truth is defined only by what remains invariant
under the simultaneous superposition of all available lenses.
Unit: there is no single fundamental unit.
Any element can act as a unit relative to a system.
The unit is a field, not a point.
Zero: there is no absolute zero.
There are local, equilibrium, and reference zeros.
OMNIA considers all of them.
Arithmetic, bases, and divisibility are not denied.
They lose only their axiomatic status.
Prime numbers, within this field, emerge as
structurally resistant units:
elements that do not collapse under any simultaneous lens.
The order of primes is not imposed.
It results from their structural resistance.
OMNIA does not predict, classify, or decide.
It measures invariance.
What survives all lenses is the only admissible form of truth.
