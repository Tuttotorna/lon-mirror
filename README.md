## Overview

**OMNIA** is a **post-hoc structural measurement engine**.

It measures **structural coherence, instability, compatibility, limits, perturbations, and inference regimes**
of representations under **independent, non-semantic transformations**.

OMNIA:

- does **not** interpret meaning
- does **not** decide
- does **not** optimize
- does **not** learn
- does **not** explain

OMNIA measures:

- what remains invariant when representation changes
- where continuation becomes structurally impossible
- how structure degrades under perturbation
- **which inferential regime is active before collapse**

The output is **measurement**, never narrative.

## Core Principle

> **Structural truth is what survives the removal of representation.**

## The OMNIA Measurement Chain

OMNIA  
→ Ω  
→ Ω under transformations  
→ Ω̂ (Omega-set)  
→ ΔΩ / ΔC  
→ SEI (Saturation)  
→ A → B → A′  
→ IRI (Irreversibility)  
→ **Inference State (S1–S5)**  
→ OMNIA-LIMIT (STOP)  
→ SCI (Structural Compatibility)  
→ CG (Runtime STOP / CONTINUE)  
→ OPI (Observer Perturbation Index)  
→ PV (Perturbation Vector)

Each step is **measured**, never inferred.

## 1. Ω — Structural Coherence Score

Ω is the aggregated structural score produced by OMNIA lenses.

It reflects **internal structural consistency**, not correctness or semantic truth.

Ω is model-agnostic and semantics-free.

---

## 2. Structural Lenses

### BASE — Omniabase  
Multi-base numeric structure analysis.

### TIME — Omniatempo  
Temporal drift and regime instability.

### CAUSA — Omniacausa  
Lagged relational structure.

### TOKEN  
Structural instability in token sequences.

### LCR — Logical Coherence Reduction  
External coherence lens for audit and benchmarking.

---

## 3. APERSPECTIVE — Aperspective Invariance

Measures invariants that persist under transformations **without a privileged observer**.

Isolates structure that is real but non-experiential.

---

## 4. Ω̂ — Omega-set (Residual Invariance)

Ω̂ is **deduced by subtraction**, not assumed.

It estimates the structural residue surviving representation change.

---

## 5. SEI — Saturation / Exhaustion Index

Measures marginal structural yield:

> SEI = ΔΩ / ΔC

SEI ≈ 0 indicates saturation.

---

## 6. IRI — Irreversibility / Hysteresis Index

Measures irrecoverable structural loss in cycles:

A → B → A′

---

## 7. Pre-Limit Inference States (NEW)

OMNIA includes a **deterministic pre-limit inference sensor**.

This module classifies **how inference behaves structurally before OMNIA-LIMIT**.

### States (S1–S5)

- **S1 — RIGID_INVARIANCE**  
  Deterministic structural residue

- **S2 — ELASTIC_INVARIANCE**  
  Deformable but coherent structure

- **S3 — META_STABLE**  
  Order-sensitive, illusion-prone regime

- **S4 — COHERENT_DRIFT**  
  Directional structural movement

- **S5 — PRE_LIMIT_FRAGMENTATION**  
  Imminent collapse

Inference is treated as a **trajectory**, not a decision.

Implementation:

omnia/inference/

---

## 8. OMNIA-LIMIT — Epistemic Boundary

Declares a **STOP** condition.

Triggered when:
- SEI → 0
- IRI > 0
- Ω̂ stable

OMNIA-LIMIT does not retry or optimize.

---

## 9. Structural Time (τ)

A non-human time coordinate advancing **only when structure changes**.

---

## 10. Structural Compatibility — SCI

Measures whether measured structures can coexist **without contradiction**.

---

## 11. Compatibility Guard — CG

Converts SCI into a strict runtime **STOP / CONTINUE** signal.

Introduces no policy.

---

## 12. Observer Perturbation Index — OPI

Measures the structural cost of introducing an observer.

> OPI = Ω_ap − Ω_obs

---

## 13. Perturbation Vector — PV

Formalizes **how structure is destroyed**, not why.

---

## 14. Repository Structure

omnia/ inference/ lenses/ meta/ runtime/ omega_set.py sei.py iri.py docs/

All modules are:

- deterministic
- standalone
- import-safe

---

## 15. What OMNIA Is Not

- Not a model
- Not an evaluator
- Not a policy
- Not a decision system
- Not a truth oracle
- Not a narrative framework

**OMNIA is a measurement instrument.**
