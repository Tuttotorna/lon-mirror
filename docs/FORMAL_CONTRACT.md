# OMNIA — FORMAL STRUCTURAL CONTRACT
## MB-X.01

**Status:** Binding  
**Scope:** Entire OMNIA ecosystem  
**Author:** Massimiliano Brighindi

---

## 0. Purpose

This document defines the **formal, non-negotiable structural contract** of **OMNIA**.

Any component, extension, integration, publication, or interpretation that violates this contract **is not OMNIA**, regardless of naming, intent, or implementation quality.

OMNIA is defined by **what it measures**, **what it forbids**, and **where it must stop**.

---

## 1. Foundational Axioms

1. **Measurement precedes interpretation**  
2. **Structure precedes meaning**  
3. **Invariance precedes truth claims**  
4. **Limits are first-class results**  
5. **Undecidability is not uncertainty**

These axioms are enforced structurally, not philosophically.

---

## 2. Core Invariants (Mandatory)

The following invariants **must always hold**.

### 2.1 Ω — Structural Coherence

- Ω ∈ [0, 1]
- Ω is **semantics-free**
- Ω is **model-agnostic**
- Ω is **deterministic**

Violation ⇒ implementation invalid.

---

### 2.2 Ω̂ — Omega-set (Residual Invariance)

- Ω̂ is **deduced by subtraction**
- Ω̂ cannot be asserted or assumed
- Ω̂ must be stable under admissible transformations

If Ω̂ is unstable ⇒ further extraction is forbidden.

---

### 2.3 SEI — Saturation / Exhaustion Index

SEI = ΔΩ / ΔC

- ΔC must be strictly defined
- ε-safe division required
- SEI ≈ 0 ⇒ **structural saturation**

SEI is a **limit detector**, not an optimizer.

---

### 2.4 IRI — Irreversibility Index

- IRI ≥ 0 always
- IRI = 0 ⇔ no irreversible loss
- IRI > 0 ⇔ collapse has occurred

IRI detects **structural hysteresis**, even when surface similarity exists.

---

### 2.5 OPI — Observer Perturbation Index

OPI = Ω_ap − Ω_obs

- Measures **structural damage due to projection**
- Does **not** measure consciousness, intent, or agency
- OPI ≥ 0 is typical but not enforced

Observer ≠ cause of collapse  
Projection = cause of loss

---

### 2.6 SI — Structural Indistinguishability

**Formal rule:**

> If all observable structural relations are invariant,  
> internal codifications are undecidable.

- SI is **not probability**
- SI is **not epistemic uncertainty**
- SI is a **hard comparability limit**

If SI holds, **no further distinction is admissible**.

---

## 3. Inference Regime Constraints

Inference in OMNIA is **measured**, never executed.

### Allowed States (Pre-Limit)

- S1 — Rigid Invariance  
- S2 — Elastic Invariance  
- S3 — Meta-Stable  
- S4 — Coherent Drift  
- S5 — Pre-Limit Fragmentation  

Inference is a **trajectory descriptor**, not a decision.

Any attempt to optimize, choose, or act **inside OMNIA** violates this contract.

---

## 4. OMNIA-LIMIT (STOP Clause)

OMNIA **must stop** when all of the following hold:

- SEI → 0  
- IRI > 0  
- Ω̂ stable  

At this point:

- No retry
- No refinement
- No escalation
- No policy fallback

Continuation beyond this point is **structural malpractice**.

---

## 5. Structural Compatibility Guard (CG)

- CG ∈ {STOP, CONTINUE}
- CG is derived **only** from SCI
- CG introduces:
  - no semantics
  - no intent
  - no optimization

CG is a **runtime structural gate**, not a decision layer.

---

## 6. Determinism Guarantee

OMNIA guarantees:

- Identical input ⇒ identical output
- No randomness
- No learning
- No adaptive state

Any stochastic behavior disqualifies the implementation.

---

## 7. Separation of Concerns (Non-Negotiable)

The following separations **must never be violated**:

- Measurement ≠ Inference ≠ Decision
- Structure ≠ Meaning
- Observation ≠ Projection
- Limit detection ≠ Failure

OMNIA occupies **measurement only**.

---

## 8. Forbidden Capabilities

OMNIA **must not**:

- Interpret meaning
- Decide actions
- Optimize outputs
- Generate narratives
- Resolve undecidable distinctions
- تجاوز (override) its own STOP condition

Any system that does so is **outside contract**.

---

## 9. Valid Scope of Application

OMNIA is valid for:

- Structural comparison
- Invariance detection
- Collapse detection
- Saturation detection
- Indistinguishability certification

OMNIA is **not valid** for:

- Truth adjudication
- Policy enforcement
- Ethical reasoning
- Human intent modeling

---

## 10. Epistemic Clause (Final)

When OMNIA stops, **knowledge extraction is complete**.

Any system that continues past OMNIA-LIMIT is no longer measuring reality,
but **projecting structure it cannot justify**.

---

## 11. Identity Clause

This contract defines **OMNIA**.

Anything that violates it may be inspired by OMNIA,
but **is not OMNIA**.
