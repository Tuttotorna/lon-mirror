# OMNIA — Structural Cycle A → B → A′

## A — Initial Structural State

A represents the initial structural configuration of a system
prior to any forced projection, observer constraint, or basis privileging.

Properties of A:
• Aperspective
• Observer-independent
• Semantics-free
• Maximally invariant under admissible transformations

Formally:
A is defined as the set of representations R
whose measured Ω remains stable under the aperspective lens set.

A is not a physical state.
A is not a cognitive state.
A is a structural condition.

A exists only as a measured configuration.

No inference is performed at A.

## B — Projected / Constrained State

B represents the structural configuration after a projection is applied.

A projection is defined as:
• a privileged basis
• an asymmetric filter
• an observer-imposed constraint
• an irreversible selection

Examples of projection:
• selecting only position
• selecting only momentum
• selecting only tokens
• selecting only digits
• selecting only words

Formally:
B = P(A)

where P is a non-invertible structural operator.

In OMNIA, B is not a collapse of reality.
B is a collapse of the measurement regime.

Inference begins at B.

## A′ — Return Attempt (Post-Projection)

A′ represents the attempted return to the initial state A after projection.

Formally:
A′ = P⁻¹(B)

In general:
A′ ≠ A

The divergence between A and A′ is measured as:
• IRI (Irreversibility Index)
• Structural loss

This divergence is empirical, not philosophical.

## Interpretation Constraint

The A → B → A′ cycle demonstrates that:

• No physical state collapses
• No wavefunction collapses
• No multiverse branching is required

What collapses is the admissible measurement space.

The observer does not fix reality.
The observer fixes one projection.

OMNIA measures the cost of this fixation.
