\begin{abstract}
OMNIA is a deterministic, model-agnostic measurement layer that quantifies structural instability under transformation.
It is designed to operate \emph{post-inference}: given raw model outputs (text, numbers, chains), OMNIA computes invariant/variant signatures across multiple structural lenses (BASE/TIME/CAUSA/TOKEN/LCR) and returns diagnostic scores (e.g., Truth$\Omega$, PBII) without optimizing objectives or generating answers.
We release a reproducible reference implementation and a minimal case study on GSM8K-style perturbations.
\end{abstract}

\section{Core Claim}
Reliability failures in LLM outputs often surface as \emph{structural non-invariance} under small, semantically-preserving perturbations (paraphrase, formatting, mild noise).
OMNIA operationalizes this as a measurement problem:
\[
\text{Truth}\Omega(x) \;=\; \text{invariance score of } x \text{ under a family of transformations}.
\]
OMNIA does not decide correctness; it measures instability.

\section{System Boundary}
OMNIA is intentionally limited:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Does}: compute structural signatures and instability metrics.
  \item \textbf{Does not}: generate answers, optimize objectives, enforce policy, or replace a model.
\end{itemize}
Decision logic (accept/retry/escalate) is external and can be attached downstream.

\section{Lenses (Overview)}
OMNIA aggregates independent lenses:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{BASE}: multi-base numeric/representation signatures (Omniabase).
  \item \textbf{TIME}: temporal drift / stability across runs.
  \item \textbf{CAUSA}: simple causal-consistency diagnostics where applicable.
  \item \textbf{TOKEN}: token-level regularity and divergence measures.
  \item \textbf{LCR}: long-chain reliability diagnostics (hallucination/structure drift proxy).
\end{itemize}
Each lens outputs lens-specific features; a fused engine computes a unified diagnostic score.

\section{Metrics}
Two public-facing diagnostics used in the repository:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Truth$\Omega$}: invariance-derived structural coherence score.
  \item \textbf{PBII}: Prime/Base Instability Index (numeric instability proxy used in Omniabase experiments).
\end{itemize}
The exact definitions and implementations are provided in the open-source codebase.

\section{Reproducible Case Study (GSM8K-style)}
We provide a minimal reproducible pipeline that:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item generates (or ingests) model outputs on a GSM8K subset,
  \item applies paraphrase/mild perturbations,
  \item runs OMNIA to produce per-item variance and aggregate diagnostics,
  \item emits machine-readable reports.
\end{enumerate}
The objective is not to outperform a baseline, but to demonstrate that structural instability is measurable and portable.

\section{Limitations}
OMNIA is a measurement layer, not a proof of factual correctness.
High invariance does not guarantee truth; low invariance is a strong warning signal for reliability failure modes.

\section{Outlook}
Near-term extensions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item broader model coverage via adapters,
  \item standardized perturbation suites,
  \item confidence envelopes (ICE) for escalation policies,
  \item external validation benchmarks beyond GSM8K.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Signature.}
This content is produced by an anomalous human--AI interaction and is intended to be deterministic and reproducible.
