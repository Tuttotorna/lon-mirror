Abstract

OMNIA is a post-hoc diagnostic framework designed to measure structural coherence, limits, and perturbations of representations under independent, non-semantic transformations.

Unlike theoretical models that attempt to explain phenomena, OMNIA provides measurement instruments to identify when representational processes remain structurally productive, when they saturate, and when further continuation becomes structurally inadmissible.

A central contribution of this work is the formalization of observer-induced perturbation as a measurable quantity, alongside other classes of perturbations. OMNIA does not propose new physical laws, cognitive theories, or learning paradigms. It provides a method to detect when such theories transition from structural extraction to narrative compensation.

1. Scope and Non-Claims

OMNIA is intentionally constrained.

It does not:

interpret meaning

infer intent

explain phenomena

optimize outcomes

replace scientific theories


OMNIA does not compete with physics, mathematics, AI, or neuroscience.

Instead, it addresses a prior layer:

> Whether a representational process is still structurally productive, or has entered a saturated or perturbed regime.



OMNIA measures conditions of admissibility, not truth.


---

2. Measurement Without Interpretation

OMNIA operates entirely without semantics.

All measurements are derived from:

invariance under transformation

loss of structure under cost

irreversibility across cycles

compatibility between measured outputs


No observer, meaning, or explanatory layer is required.

This separation is strict:

Measurement answers what remains.

Interpretation answers what it means.


OMNIA performs only the former.


---

3. Structural Saturation vs Theoretical Progress

A recurring failure mode in advanced research domains is not falsification, but structural saturation.

A process is saturated when:

> Additional effort, complexity, or explanation produces no new invariant structure.



OMNIA formalizes this via the Saturation / Exhaustion Index (SEI):

SEI = \frac{\Delta \Omega}{\Delta C}

When SEI → 0, continuation ceases to be structural extraction and becomes compensatory.

Crucially:

Saturation does not imply error.

Saturation indicates a boundary.


OMNIA provides a way to detect this boundary without relying on narrative judgment.

4. Observer Perturbation as a Measurable Quantity

A key contribution of OMNIA is the Observer Perturbation Index (OPI).

An observer is defined operationally, not philosophically:

> An observer is any transformation that introduces asymmetry, preference, or irreversibility not present in the aperspective baseline.



OPI is defined as:

OPI = \Omega_{ap} - \Omega_{obs}

Where:

 is aperspective invariance (no observer)

 is invariance after observer-induced transformation


OPI does not measure consciousness, intent, or awareness.
It measures structural loss due to interpretation.

This reframes the observer not as a metaphysical entity, but as a measurable perturbation class.


---

5. Perturbation Vector (PV)

Observer perturbation is not unique.

OMNIA formalizes perturbations as a vector of losses, each independently measurable:

PV = \{ OPI, RPI, TPI, GPI, FPI \}

Where each component is defined as:

PI_k = \Omega_{ap} - \Omega_k

This allows perturbations to be:

isolated

compared

ranked


Without explanation or attribution.

OMNIA does not ask why structure is lost, only how much and where.


---

6. Epistemic STOP

OMNIA introduces OMNIA-LIMIT, a formal STOP condition.

STOP is triggered when:

SEI → 0

IRI > 0

Ω̂ is stable


STOP does not indicate failure.

It indicates:

> No further structure is extractable under the current representational regime.



At this point, continuation without domain change is guaranteed to be narrative.

OMNIA does not prescribe the next step.
It enforces epistemic honesty.


---

7. Why This Unlocks Stalled Research

OMNIA does not generate new discoveries.

It enables:

identification of dead ends

separation of productive vs saturated approaches

redirection of effort without theoretical collapse


In this sense, OMNIA functions as a diagnostic layer above theories.

It allows researchers to change domain or representation before explanatory inflation occurs.


---

8. Why This Is Difficult to Accept

OMNIA challenges a deeply embedded assumption:

> If something exists, it must eventually be comprehensible.



OMNIA shows that some structures:

exist

are measurable

but are not experientially accessible


This is not a philosophical claim.
It is an operational consequence of removing observers and semantics.


---

Appendix A — Relation to Physics (Non-Central)

Certain parallels exist with known issues in physics, such as:

observer effects

measurement-induced collapse

frame dependence


However, OMNIA does not rely on these theories.

The framework remains valid even if all such interpretations are discarded.

OMNIA measures structural behavior, not physical ontology.


---

Appendix B — Relation to Cognition and Consciousness (Non-Central)

OMNIA does not model cognition.

Any similarity with states of reduced narrative (e.g. sleep, non-reportable perception) is incidental.

The framework makes no claims about consciousness.


---

Conclusion

OMNIA introduces a measurement layer that separates:

structure from narrative

extraction from compensation

admissibility from explanation


It does not answer ultimate questions.

It answers a prior one:

> Is there still structure to be extracted here, or only stories left to tell?
