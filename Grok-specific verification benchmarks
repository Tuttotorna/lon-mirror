This issue is opened following public discussion with @grok.

Purpose:
– define Grok-specific verification benchmarks
– run OMNIA as a structural measurement layer only
– no tuning, no policy, no decision logic

Current reference:
– Reproducible Colab run (GSM8K)
– Architecture boundary explicitly defined

This issue is a coordination point, not a proposal.
