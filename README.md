OMNIA_TOTALE — Unified Structural Stability Engine

Author: Massimiliano Brighindi (MB-X.01)

OMNIA_TOTALE is a unified engine for evaluating structural stability, coherence, and anomaly patterns in numerical sequences, time series, and large-language-model (LLM) reasoning chains.

It is model-agnostic, entirely deterministic, and built around three complementary analytical lenses:

Omniabase — structural behavior of integers across multiple bases

Omniatempo — temporal regime-shift analysis

Omniacausa — lag-based causal structure inference


These are fused into a single Ω-score that summarizes overall stability.

The project aims to support AI safety research, reduce hallucinations in CoT reasoning, and offer interpretable signals for debugging and auditing model behavior.

The Three Analytical Lenses

1. Omniabase — Multi-Base Numeric Stability

A number is represented across many bases (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, …).
For each base, we compute:

digit entropy

symmetry score σ_b

divisibility-based structure bonus

PBII — Prime Base Instability Index


PBII serves as a strong signal of numerical inconsistency in reasoning chains.


---

2. Omniatempo — Temporal Regime-Shift Detector

For a 1D time series:

global mean/std

short- vs long-window mean/std

symmetric KL divergence between short and long distributions → regime_change_score


This captures drift, instability, and transitions between behavioral regimes.


---

3. Omniacausa — Lagged Causal Structure

Given a set of aligned time series:

compute lagged correlations for lags ∈ [−L, +L]

pick the strongest lag per pair

threshold and return a directed edge list


This produces a lightweight causal graph used inside Ω-fusion.


---

Ω-Fusion (OMNIA_TOTALE)

OMNIA_TOTALE_v2.0.py computes:

Ω = w_base  · PBII_instability
  + w_tempo · log(1 + regime_change)
  + w_causa · mean(|lagged_correlations|)

The output includes:

Omniabase signature

Omniatempo analysis

Omniacausa graph

final Ω-score

component-wise breakdown



---

Benchmarks

1. Hallucination Detection (GSM8K synthetic demonstration)

File: gsm8k_benchmark_demo.py

Includes:

numeric extraction from reasoning chains

PBII computation per chain

synthetic correct vs perturbed chains

hallucination detection rate

PBII distribution plot (saved as PBII_distribution.png)


Internal evaluations show strong separation between stable and unstable chains.


---

2. Prime vs Composite — AUC Evaluation

random integers

PBII separation

custom NumPy AUC implementation

typical output: AUC ≈ 0.98


Plot included in the repo.
