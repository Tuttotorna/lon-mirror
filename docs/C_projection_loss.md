# OMNIA — Structural Projection Loss (Cycle A → B → A′)

## Definition

Given a structural state A measured aperspectively,
and a projected state B obtained via a privileged basis P,
OMNIA defines the loss induced by projection as a measurable quantity.

This quantity is called:

• SPL — Structural Projection Loss

SPL quantifies how much structure is destroyed
when a projection is enforced.

---

## Formalization

Let:

Ω_ap  = Ω(A)  measured with aperspective measurers  
Ω_proj = Ω(B) measured with projected measurers  

Then:

SPL_abs = max(0, Ω_ap − Ω_proj)

SPL_rel = SPL_abs / Ω_ap

---

## Interpretation

• SPL ≈ 0  
  → projection preserves structure  
• SPL > 0  
  → projection destroys structure  

This loss is structural, not semantic.

---

## Relation to the A → B → A′ Cycle

A′ is obtained by attempting to revert B back to A.

If:

A′ ≠ A

then irreversibility exists.

This irreversibility is not metaphysical.
It is measured.

## Collapse Reinterpretation

What is traditionally called “collapse” is:

• not a collapse of reality
• not a collapse of state
• not a branching of universes

It is a collapse of admissible measurement regimes.

SPL measures that collapse.
## Observer Perturbation Index (OPI)

OMNIA defines the Observer Perturbation Index as:

OPI = Ω_ap − Ω_obs

where:
• Ω_ap is measured without privileged basis
• Ω_obs is measured with observer-induced constraints

OPI ≈ SPL_abs

Therefore:

SPL and OPI are two views of the same phenomenon:
the structural cost of observation.

---

## Consequence

The observer does not collapse the system.

The observer collapses the measurement space.

OMNIA quantifies this collapse.
