# Boundary Curve Artifact — MB-X.01 / OMNIA

Diagnostic artifact showing representational saturation:
H(k) → 1 as global tension D → 1.

Different constraint paths (Γ1, Γ2) reach the boundary at different k,
demonstrating path-dependent structural limits.

No semantics. No decisions. Measurement only.
