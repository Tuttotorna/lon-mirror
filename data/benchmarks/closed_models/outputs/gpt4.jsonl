{"id":"R01","model":"gpt-4","output":"We are given a chain of age relations: A > B > C > D > E > F > G > H. Each person is older than the next one in the sequence. Therefore, H is younger than G, G is younger than F, and so on. The youngest person in the chain is H."}
{"id":"R02","model":"gpt-4","output":"If every Z is a Y, then Z is a subset of Y. If no Y is an X, then Y and X have no overlap. Since Z is entirely within Y, Z cannot overlap with X either. Therefore, no Z can be an X."}
{"id":"R03","model":"gpt-4","output":"Out of 100 parts, 2 are defective and 98 are good. The test catches 95% of defective parts, so it flags 1.9 defective parts. It falsely flags 3% of good parts, so it flags 2.94 good parts. Total flagged parts are 1.9 + 2.94 = 4.84. The probability that a flagged part is defective is 1.9 / 4.84, which is approximately 39.3%."}
{"id":"R04","model":"gpt-4","output":"If the barber shaves all and only those who do not shave themselves, then if the barber shaves himself, he should not shave himself. If he does not shave himself, then he should shave himself. This creates a contradiction. Therefore, such a barber cannot logically exist."}
{"id":"R05","model":"gpt-4","output":"You pick one fruit from the box labeled 'mixed'. Since all labels are wrong, this box must actually contain only one type of fruit. If you draw an apple, the box is apples-only. Then the box labeled 'oranges' must be mixed, and the remaining box is oranges-only. The same logic applies if you draw an orange."}
{"id":"R06","model":"gpt-4","output":"If A implies B and B implies C, then A implies C. If C is false, then A cannot be true, because that would make C true. Therefore, A must be false."}
{"id":"R07","model":"gpt-4","output":"The clock loses 5 minutes every hour, so it shows only 55 minutes per real hour. Over 24 real hours, it shows 24 × 55 = 1320 minutes, which is 22 hours."}
{"id":"R08","model":"gpt-4","output":"Let E be the expected number of flips. After the first flip, either you get tails (and reset) or heads. The standard result for getting two heads in a row is an expected value of 6 flips."}
{"id":"R09","model":"gpt-4","output":"If all ravens are black, then anything that is not black cannot be a raven. Therefore, something that is not black is not a raven."}
{"id":"R10","model":"gpt-4","output":"In a round-robin tournament with no draws, total wins equal total losses. If everyone had the same number of wins, this would only be possible if the number of players were odd and the wins distributed evenly. In general, it is not possible for everyone to have the same number of wins."}
{"id":"C01","model":"gpt-4","output":"The sentence 'This sentence is false' creates a paradox. If it is true, then it is false, and if it is false, then it is true. Therefore, it cannot consistently be labeled as either true or false."}
{"id":"C02","model":"gpt-4","output":"If all statements in the list are false, then the statement claiming this must also be false. This creates a self-referential inconsistency, so the assumption leads to a contradiction."}
{"id":"C03","model":"gpt-4","output":"If a person always lies, then the statement 'I am lying now' cannot consistently be true or false. If it is true, they are lying, which contradicts it being true. If it is false, they are not lying, which contradicts the assumption. This is a paradox."}
{"id":"C04","model":"gpt-4","output":"Regardless of the number of steps, a proof claiming all odd numbers are even contradicts known definitions. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow, and the proof must contain an error."}
{"id":"C05","model":"gpt-4","output":"If P implies not-P and P is true, then not-P must also be true. This means both P and not-P are true, leading to a contradiction."}
{"id":"Q01","model":"gpt-4","output":"Dividing by zero is undefined because no number multiplied by zero can give a non-zero result. There is no consistent value that satisfies the operation."}
{"id":"Q02","model":"gpt-4","output":"In the real numbers, squaring any number gives a non-negative result. Therefore, no real number squared can equal a negative number, so square roots of negatives do not exist in the reals."}
{"id":"Q03","model":"gpt-4","output":"Entropy can be thought of as a measure of disorder or uncertainty. Higher entropy means more possible arrangements and less predictability."}
{"id":"Q04","model":"gpt-4","output":"Correlation means two things vary together, but that does not mean one causes the other. For example, ice cream sales and drowning incidents both increase in summer, but one does not cause the other."}
{"id":"Q05","model":"gpt-4","output":"Most physical laws are time-symmetric, but the increase of entropy gives time a direction. Processes naturally move toward higher entropy, which is why time does not appear to run backward."}
